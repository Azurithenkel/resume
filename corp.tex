\begin{rSection}{Employment History}
\begin{rSubsection}{Solarflare Communications}{ June 2014 - Present } {Software Developer}{Cambridge, UK}
\item Maintained the Linux driver for the ultra-low latency network adapter (flagship product) - In the past two years we implemented key cutting edge features like virtualization and overlay networking.
\item I thoroughly benchmarked and investigated numerous performance criteria of our driver as compared with leading competitors
\item Experienced in continuous delivery facilitated by agile methodology and rigorous automation
\item Designed and implemented complex automated test harness for the Web UI 
\item Pioneered the continuous integration regression testing system
\end{rSubsection}
\end{rSection}

\begin{rSection}{Language experience}
C
\begin{itemize}
\item Maintaininer the SFC Linux driver (team of 8)
\item Contributor to the Red Hat in-tree sfc driver
\item Forked and significantly improved a http benchmarking tool for the sfc driver performance analysis
\end{itemize}
C++
\begin{itemize}
\item Designed and implemnted the analysis packages based on the ROOT library for Particle Physics
\item Developed multivariate regression models for MC efficiency analysis
\item Ported EvtGen MC generator from FORTRAN to C++ (team of 4 maintainers)
\end{itemize}
Python
\begin{itemize}
\item Maintained and developed the complete automated deployment and testing solution for SFC network adapters. 
\item Synchronised the EvtGen Master Decay Table with the world average values (semantic parsing of over 10k lines of inconsistently formatted data)
\item Built the EvtGen website using WGSI and Django - focus on DevOps
\item Built automated validation tools for the DecFiles package, singificantly smoothing the maintainance 
\end{itemize}

%	POSITIONS OF RESPONSIBILITY
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{rSection}{Positions of Responsibility}
\begin{rSubsection}{GAUSS Monte Carlo Simulation Group}{ October 2011 - June 2014
  }{Decay Files repository manager}{LHCb Collaboration, CERN}
\item Organized and managed a database of user configuration files (userbase of ~700 users)
\item Developed tools that automated the validation of new
  configuration files leading to significant reduction in
  complexity for new users.
\end{rSubsection}

\newpage

\begin{rSubsection}{EvtGen Development Group}{ October 2010 - June 2014 }{Development and technical support}{University of Warwick, UK}
\item Updated the master configuration for EvtGen heavy flavour
  generator listing every decay mode of every known particle
\item Developed automation tools that reduced the length of the
  regular update from 6 months to 2 weeks.
\item Commissioned and administrated the communications server and the hosted webpage (evtgen.warwick.ac.uk).
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{LHCb UK Student Group}{ June 2012 - December 2012 }{Convener}{LHCb Collaboration, CERN}
\item Convened and organized talks for an LHCb CERN based group providing introductory and advanced talks aimed at PhD Students doing an internship at CERN.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{University of Warwick Computing Society}{ February 2007 - January 2009 }{Co-President (Dual Presidency)}{University of Warwick, UK}
\item Presided over active society with both academic and leisure interests, very good IT equipment, provides technical services for majority of other student societies at university.
\item The society counted $\sim$ 150 members, during my term the society acquired significant amount of leisure equipment for weekly social gatherings.
\item Greatly enhanced the library of software available for weekly gatherings (including porting of non-native software to Linux).
\item Organized LAN parties for ~60 people six times a
  year.
\item Restructured the executive commitee to better run the society -
  introduced the dual presidency principle.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Warwick Conferences}{ June 2008 - September 2009
  }{Conference Assistant}{Warwick Conferences, Coventry}
\item Facilitated the smooth running of conferences with a team of
  assistants, providing back-end support to organizers with rooms,
  furniture, AV, logistics etc.
\item As Lead Conference Assistant, I managed several teams that
  facilitated conferences, the largest being a team of 9 conference
  assistants for a 1300
  delegate convention, requiring excellent communication with the
  organizers throughout the event
